## README:

__Installation:__
Install via “make”, clean executables via “make clean”

__Usage:__
The program should be run via commandline

Run the server program and the navigate to the address 127.0.0.1:8001
(or localhost:8001) on your browser. You will receive some test data
rendered into the html template at _files/index.html_.

__Notes:__
At the current stage only one connection is accepted at a time. The code
also renders some junk data at the end of the template, the code doesn't
for now support rendering html from file either. This version is mainly at
the 'proof of concept' stage.

Forementioned issues will be corrected in the near future.
